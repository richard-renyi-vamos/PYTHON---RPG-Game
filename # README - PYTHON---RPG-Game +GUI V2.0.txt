Creating a basic RPG game in Python is a fun project! Here’s a simple text-based RPG game that includes player stats, a simple battle system, and the ability to level up. This code covers a basic structure you can expand upon.

python
Copy code
import random
import time

class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, health, attack, defense):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense
        self.level = 1
        self.experience = 0

    def is_alive(self):
        return self.health > 0

    def attack_target(self, target):
        damage = max(0, self.attack - target.defense) + random.randint(-2, 5)
        target.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacks {target.name} for {damage} damage!")
        time.sleep(1)

    def gain_experience(self, exp):
        self.experience += exp
        print(f"{self.name} gains {exp} experience points!")
        if self.experience >= 10 * self.level:
            self.level_up()

    def level_up(self):
        self.level += 1
        self.health += 5
        self.attack += 2
        self.defense += 1
        self.experience = 0
        print(f"\n🎉 {self.name} leveled up to level {self.level}! 🎉")

            return

    elif not enemy.is_alive():

        if player.is_alive():
            print(f"\n{player.name} continues the journey...\n")
            time.sleep(1)

    print("\nGame Over. Thanks for playing!")

Game Features:
Character Class: Creates a player with stats such as health, attack, defense, and level.
Enemy Class: Each enemy has different stats and rewards the player with experience upon defeat.
Battle System: Allows the player to attack or run away. If the player wins, they gain experience and level up when enough experience is earned.
Leveling Up: Increases player stats each time they level up.
Running the Game:
Copy and paste the code into a Python file, e.g., rpg_game.py.
Run the game by executing python rpg_game.py.
Enjoy customizing it further! 🚀🎮
